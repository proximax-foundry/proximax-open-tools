# ProximaX Tools Team.

## What is tools team?
Simply put, this team will build tools on top of the ProximaX Platform.
As you all are aware, ProximaX Sirius Platform consists of 4 different core layers - Chain, Storage, Streaming, and the Contracts. 
Each with its own capabilities for build the next innovative web3/decentralized applications.

This teamâ€™s main responsibility is to build apps/tools/automation scripts/etc - anything that we think is useful that will help 
with our goal of reaching mass adoption of our technology.

## What sort of tools?
Any tools that you think we should have build. If you do want something specific, we do have a few tasks/tools which myself and the 
core development team that we think is necessary but any application/solution that you think we need will do. 
Go to the Issues tab to check the existing tools in our backlog 

## Methodology and Approach?
Hackaton style. You either come up with your own or just pick up something on the task list to build. Each will need to give an update daily 
and we will need to showcase our apps on our core / product meeting every **end of the month**.

## Who can participate?
Anyone within or outside the team can participate. If you know someone who wants to contribute, then feel free to invite them on our telegram group chat. 

## I'm assigned or will be assigned to a project, how do I align?
Company projects are always a priority. Just make sure you align it with us. We all should be responsibile for our own projects so please do keep
track of your tasks in case someone would like to continue.
